What is Process Chain?
A process chain is a sequence of processes that wait in the background for an event.
Some of these processes trigger a separate event that can start other processes in turn.
It provides various connectors that allow alternative and parallel execution of process.
For example, a retail store receives a customer order, this will trigger a sequence of events like checking material in stockàordering the product from Warehouse order to manufacture the product and so on.
Process chains provide graphical scheduling & monitoring features to help in automation, visualization & monitoring of tasks / processes.
Process chains are integrated into portal based BI administration cockpit.
Process Chains can be thought of as flowcharts which are scheduled to wait in background & triggered for an event by another process.
Process Chain

Table of Content:

Process Chain involves three main steps

Start Process: It describes when the process will start (immediately, scheduled job, metaprocess, API)
Connector: It is a linking process, and can choose options of starting next process
Variant: The object on which we are supposed to execute the process is called as Variant. It is a set of parameters passed to the process like name of the InfoPackage or Info-Objects
Steps To Create a Process Chain
RSPC is the whole and sole transaction used for Process Chain Maintenance. In this screen, existing process chains are sorted by “ApplicationComponents”.

There are two views available:

Check View
Planning View.
The default mode is Planning View.

Step 1) Creating a Process Chain:

Click the “Create” icon.

Step 8) As discussed earlier, data load can be triggered via an InfoPackage or a DTP.

If the dataload is to be done via an InfoPackage, use the Process type “Execute InfoPackage”
If the dataload is to be done via a DTP, use the Process type “Data Transfer Process”

Step 9) A new pop-up window appears. Here you can choose the required InfoPackage.
