What is Process Chain?
A process chain is a sequence of processes that wait in the background for an event.
Some of these processes trigger a separate event that can start other processes in turn.
It provides various connectors that allow alternative and parallel execution of process.
For example, a retail store receives a customer order, this will trigger a sequence of events like checking material in stockàordering the product from Warehouse order to manufacture the product and so on.
Process chains provide graphical scheduling & monitoring features to help in automation, visualization & monitoring of tasks / processes.
Process chains are integrated into portal based BI administration cockpit.
Process Chains can be thought of as flowcharts which are scheduled to wait in background & triggered for an event by another process.

Process Chain involves three main steps

Start Process: It describes when the process will start (immediately, scheduled job, metaprocess, API)
Connector: It is a linking process, and can choose options of starting next process
Variant: The object on which we are supposed to execute the process is called as Variant. It is a set of parameters passed to the process like name of the InfoPackage or Info-Objects
Steps To Create a Process Chain

Step 8) As discussed earlier, data load can be triggered via an InfoPackage or a DTP.

If the dataload is to be done via an InfoPackage, use the Process type “Execute InfoPackage”
If the dataload is to be done via a DTP, use the Process type “Data Transfer Process”

Step 10) Connect both the Start Variant and the InfoPackage:

There are 2 ways to do this – Right click on first step. Click on “Connect With” ->”Load Data”

Another way is to select the “Start Variant” and keep the left mouse button pressed. Then move mouse button to the target step. An arrow should follow your movement. Stop pressing the mouse button and new connection is created. From the start process to every second step there is a black line.
